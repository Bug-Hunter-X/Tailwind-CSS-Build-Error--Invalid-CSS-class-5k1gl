This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and it's related to how Tailwind processes your CSS classes during the build process.  The error message usually indicates that Tailwind can't find or process one or more of the CSS utility classes you are using in your component's template or JSX.  For example: `Uncaught Error: Invalid CSS class: 'text-xl'`  This might happen if you've misspelled a class name, if the class isn't defined in your Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js), or if there's a problem with how Tailwind is integrated into your project's build pipeline.
